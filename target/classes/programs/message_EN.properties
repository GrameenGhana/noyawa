RITA2-cw8-{d1}=U may have heard many things about contraceptives. They do not cause barrenness but some do have side effects.Go to a No Yawa clinic or call us to get the truth.
RITA-cw9-{d1}=ECP should not be used as a regular contraceptive method, it is only for emergencies like when ur usual contraceptive fails.

RITA-cw16-{d1}=STIs can cause health challenges for both men and women, like difficulty getting pregnant when u are ready. Go to a clinic with ur partner to be tested.
